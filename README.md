# FoodRecog

This project contains our codes for experiments on two datasets, i.e. VireoFood-172 and Food101 datasets. 

The codes used for each dataset are organized in the respective folders, which has three categories:
1. TextProcessing: that processes the ingredient text of the dataset to produce the data as input to our ingredient channel.
2. Models: that includes the models trained sequentially to obtain our final model. 
3. ModelTest: that includes the codes for testing the performance of the models in the "Models" folder.
